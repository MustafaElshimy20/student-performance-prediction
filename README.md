# Predicting Student Performance Based on Study Hours and Attendance

## Project Overview

This project predicts student exam scores based on two key factors: **study hours** and **attendance percentage**. By using machine learning, we aim to help educators identify at-risk students and provide interventions to improve their outcomes.

## Tools Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Mathematical operations and array handling.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for model building.
  - `matplotlib`: Plotting and visualization.
  - `seaborn`: Data visualization (for statistical plots).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

| Student ID | Study Hours | Attendance (%) | Exam Score |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1          | 5           | 80             | 75         |
| 2          | 10          | 90             | 85         |
| 3          | 15          | 70             | 65         |
| 4          | 12          | 85             | 80         |
| 5          | 8           | 60             | 70         |

**Note**: The dataset contains data for 100 students.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned, normalized, and split into training and test sets.
2. **Modeling**: A **Linear Regression** model was used to predict **Exam Score** based on **Study Hours** and **Attendance (%)**.
3. **Evaluation**: Model performance was evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared (R²)**.

## Results

- **R-squared (R²)**: 0.89, meaning the model explains 89% of the variance in the exam scores.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 1.96, indicating an average deviation of 1.96 points from the actual scores.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 5.93, representing the average squared difference between predicted and actual scores.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
